    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Ultra! I'm a high school student, aspiring engineer and literacy enjoyer from South Asia, and this is my personal website. If you are curious, I am interested in nuclear physics, computer hardware and central planning and I also happen to hate capitalism, illegibility and Chromium.</p>
<h1>About this Site</h1>
<p>I made this website for fun, even though making it is anything but. I do like to archive my essays on here, and publish some photos and arts from time to time. I plan on making more fun stuff in the future.</p>
<h2>Anatomy</h2>
<p>This website was created with 11ty and hosted on Neocities. I use Deploy To Neocities to upload the site from a Github repo to Neocities. Fonts used in this site is Instrument Serif, Source Serif 4 and Radio Canada Big, all of them open-source and available on Google Fonts.
