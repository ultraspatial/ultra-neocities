# About the Webmaster
Hi, my name is Ultra! I am a high-school student, aspiring engineer and literate person from Bangladesh. I like nuclear reactors, old computers and central planning, and I dislike capitalism, inaccessible design and idealist philosophy.
# About this Site
I created this website to archive essays and photographs that I create. This place is a piece of my mind, so you might learn something about me here.
## Anatomy
This website was created with 11ty and hosted on Neocities. I use Deploy To Neocities to upload the site from a Github repo to Neocities. Fonts used in this site is Instrument Serif, Source Serif 4 and Radio Canada Big, all of them open-source and available on Google Fonts.
