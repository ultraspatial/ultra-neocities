# Not Everything Is Revolutionary, You Can Just Do It If You Want.
----
As the Western world descends further into chaos, "revolution" has become the hip, new thing. What used to be a dirty word, relegated to the mouths of deranged and out-of-touch commies, is now the rallying-cry for your favourite artist, content creator and internet microceleb. You can get up on stage and advocate for revolution and keep your record deal to tell the tale.
<br />
What revolution means, however, is a harder question to answer. If you take the internet's word for it, it seems everything under the sun is revolutionary, as long as it vaguely makes you feel better. Art, joy, hobbies, making a website. All of it, revolutionary. Possibly on par with marching down the street and declaring your city a commune.
